This is a horrible school project I was told to create for a final project. This is a Templated Binary Search Tree with Iteration.

If you wish to see the main piece of code that makes this tree work, view the MakeTree function within the [BinaryTree.tpp](https://github.com/krogenth/Data_Structures/blob/main/project_5/Templated_Binary_Tree/BinaryTree.tpp#L552) file.
